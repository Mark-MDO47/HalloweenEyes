# HalloweenEyes
Eyes in a plastic skull that detect and track people.

## The Plan
John and I will make a plastic skull with one or two eyes that will follow people. If there are multiple people, it will follow one for a while then choose another and follow that for a while.
- Based on https://learn.adafruit.com/hallowing-all-seeing-skull.
- Upgrades to use Artificial Intelligence image processing - face tracking
  - Maybe using Ultralytics approach https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHyHmOtmEgs&list=PL1FZnkj4ad1PFJTjW4mWpHZhzgJinkNV0&index=46
  - Maybe using TinyML approach
  - Maybe using OpenCV approach
